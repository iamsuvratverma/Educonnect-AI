# Educonnect-AI
This AI platform is designed to assist all students, including those with disabilities, by automating tasks and making education more accessible. In this project, we leverage Artificial Intelligence to automate various educational tasks. Our key features include real-time conversion of American Sign Language (ASL) signs to text and audio, enhancing communication for students who use sign language. Additionally, we have developed a suite of tools to aid in learning, such as a handwritten equation solver, a handwritten text extractor, a computer text extractor, and a text summarizer. These services aim to simplify and accelerate various academic tasks, making education more inclusive and efficient for everyone."
