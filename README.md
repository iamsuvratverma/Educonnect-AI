# Educonnect-AI

This AI platform, **EduConnect AI**, was developed as part of the AI **internship at IBM**. It is designed to assist all students, including those with special abilities, by automating tasks and making education more accessible. In this project, we leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) to automate various educational tasks. Our key features include **real-time conversion of American Sign Language (ASL) signs to text and audio**, enhancing communication for students who use sign language. Additionally, we have developed a suite of tools to aid in learning, such as a **handwritten equation solver, a handwritten text extractor, a computer text extractor, and a text summarizer**. These services aim to simplify and accelerate various academic tasks, making education more inclusive and efficient for everyone.
